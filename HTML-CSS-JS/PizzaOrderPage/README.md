# Pizza Order Sample

This was a javascript course module final project. The final was a front-end only project with client stipulations of ingredients and selection input types


## Description
Selections are pulled into a javascript object  and processed from there.

Initial design was loading the object properties into a table unfortunately the table struggles with horizontal overflow or scroll bars.
Selection and receipt columns were replaced with rows to give the receipt table enough space to reduce overflow.

In the future I would build the table first and populate it with javascript instead of building the table with javascript or format as a table without actually using the HTML table element.

## Deployment

All dependencies are included. Include jquery, popper, and bootstrap or link to remote sources

## Built With

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - Styling Framework
